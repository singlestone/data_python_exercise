This repository has two seperate exercises depending on the role:

1. [Data Engineer](./data_engineer/)
2. [Data Engineer Tech lead](./data_engineer_tech_lead)

The expectation is that the Python applications follow best practices.

* All code is run through pylint and passes with a 10, **no exceptions**.
* Notebooks will not be accepted. **no exceptions**. 
* All code is organized into python modules and a ```__main__.py``` file is used as the main entry point.
* All code is organized into functions and classes.
* Unit tests and Integration tests are done to a professional level.
* A ```README.md``` should be created that explains how to run the application.
